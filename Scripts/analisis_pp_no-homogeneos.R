Approach 2: Inhomogeneous Point Process Model (IPP) or Area-Weighted PPA
This approach assumes you donâ€™t want to discard any polygons, but you adjust your analysis to account for the fact that point locations and marks are influenced by area.

Concept
Instead of assuming a uniform background process, model the point pattern as intensity varying in space (e.g., based on polygon size, topography, etc.).

Step-by-Step for IPP
Step 1: Compute intensity offset (e.g., area)
You can treat polygon area as an offset or covariate

Build a spatial raster or function from it:
  
  r
Copiar
Editar
library(spatstat.geom)
area_values <- df$area_km2
locations <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(polygons_sf))
area_im <- im(area_values, xcol = unique(locations[,1]), yrow = unique(locations[,2]))
Step 2: Create inhomogeneous point pattern model
r
Copiar
Editar
library(spatstat.model)
ppm_model <- ppm(ppp_obj, ~ area, covariates = list(area = area_im))
summary(ppm_model)
Step 3: Test interaction or mark dependence
Use tools like Kinhom() or Kcross.inhom() with area as a spatial intensity adjuster

Or model marks (diversity) as a function of spatial covariates using ppm() with marks

Alternative: Area-Weighted Mark Correlation
If you're interested in mark relationships (e.g., spatial clustering of high Rao Q values), weight the analysis:

e.g., in marked K-function, normalize expected intensity using area weights.

r
Copiar
Editar
Kinhom(ppp_obj, lambda = area_weights)
